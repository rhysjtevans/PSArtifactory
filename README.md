# PSArtifactory
PSArtifactory is a PowerShell module to interact with Artifactory inspired from [PowerShell-Artifactory](https://github.com/nicholasdille/PowerShell-Artifactory) by [Nicholas Dille](http://dille.name/blog).

I wrote my own module because
  1) Updating Nicholas' API wrapper function would have involved some breaking changes.
  2) A lot more fun! :) 
  

## Getting Started
PSArtifactory has now been published to [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSArtifactory)

## Goal for v1.0.0 Feature Set
- PowerShell Core [Linux, MacOS, Windows]
- Authentication Support
  - Token
  - Username/password
- Manage Users
    - Tokens
    - Groups
    - Permissions
- Manage Files
    - Properties
- Manage Repositories
- An Artifactory PSDrive leveraging [SHiPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/SHiPS)
